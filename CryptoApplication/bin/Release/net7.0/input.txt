CBC (short for cipher-block chaining) is a AES block cipher mode that trumps the ECB mode in hiding away patterns in the plaintext. CBC mode achieves this by XOR-ing the first plaintext block (B1) with an initialization vector before encrypting it. CBC also involves block chaining as every subsequent plaintext block is XOR-ed with the ciphertext of the previous block.
